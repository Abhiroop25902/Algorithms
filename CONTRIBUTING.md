# **Contributing Guidelines**

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

Before sending a Pull Request, please ensure the following things:

- You're assigned the task to a particular issue.
- If a relevant issue already exists , please discuss it on the issue page, and get it assigned to yourself.
- If no relevant issue exist, please open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself.

**_Please process with an issue if it is assigned to you, we dont want you to waste your time and hardwork if the Pull Request isn't accepted._**

When creating a Pull Request, please ensure the following things:

- Your forked repository's `main` branch is up-to-date with original `main` repository.
- Create a new branch from `main` in your forked repository and commit your changes to that branch.
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check [this](https://github.blog/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/) for more info)
- Check that only the relevant files are being changed, there should be no unintended changes to the schema or dependency files

## Steps to follow after opening a pull request.

* Check the travis-ci continuous integration build once it completes. 
* This usually takes about 10 minutes ⏱, and if any tests fail you can find details in the build log.

### If somehow build fails / not passing then:
* Try to fix whatever caused it to fail if you can.  
* Ask for help if you cannot fix it. If a pull request build is failing but you have not asked for help, we will assume that you have seen the errors and are still working on them. 
* If you don't get reviewer feedback in couple of days ⏱, or you're waiting for followup, ping someone.
