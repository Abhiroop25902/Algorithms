## What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution *incrementally*, one piece at a time, and abandons a candidate (or "backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly result in a valid solution.

*Where is it used?* 

Usually in constraint satisfaction problems.
