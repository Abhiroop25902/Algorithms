# Linear Regression using Matrix Operation

**Warning**: Before Proceeding further, it is advised to see the scikit-learn implementation of Linear Regression as that covers the so called _big picture_ of what Linear Regression is....

This Part is more focussed into the inner working of those one line functions

This is divided into two parts:

1.  Linear Regression using one variable
    -   Here we will be working with Two Variables, an independent variable x, also called input, and a dependant variable y, called output

2.  Linear Regression with two or more variable
    -   here we generalize the one variable algorithm to take in multiple independent variables, which we collectively call the input matrix X

so, Good Luck, and Happy Learning... üòÅ
