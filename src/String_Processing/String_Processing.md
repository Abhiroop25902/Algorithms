# String Processing

A string is nothing but a sequence of symbols or characters. Sometimes, we come across problems where a string is given and the task is to search for a given pattern in that string. The straightforward method is to check by traversing the string index by index and searching for the pattern. But the process becomes slow  when the length of the 
string increases.
So, in this case hashing algorithms prove to be very useful.
